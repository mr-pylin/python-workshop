## üìã Prerequisites
   - **Basic Computer Skills**
      - Familiarity with using a computer, web browsers, and file management.
   - **Python Environment Setup**
      - Ability to set up a Python development environment, including:
         - Installation of Python ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or standalone).
         - Familiarity with using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
This project was developed using Python `v3.12.3`. If you encounter issues running the specified version of dependencies, consider using this specific Python version.

## üì¶ Installing Dependencies
You can install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions
   - Open the root folder with **VS Code**
      - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + K` followed by `Ctrl + O`
      - **macOS**: `Cmd + K` followed by `Cmd + O`
   - Open `.ipynb` files using [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension integrated with **VS Code**
   - Allow **VS Code** to install any recommended dependencies for working with Jupyter Notebooks.
   - Note: Jupyter is integrated with both **VS Code** & **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**
